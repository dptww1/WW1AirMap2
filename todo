* libjs/dt_toolbar
** see if prototype.js functions can replace ugly callback thunk stuff

* unitcollection.js
** rewrite getPreferredNation to use prototype.js' max()

* By Aerodrome Mode
** scroll so that selected aerodrome is guaranteed to be shown

* By Date
** emptydiv jasta names should click to bySquadron w/that squadron (need programmatic way to change SELECTs)
** highlight the changes (in empty div, or map, too?)
** next/prev should respect nationality changes, i.e. if only BE selected, go to next date when BE changed (regardless of GE data)

* By Squadron
** what to do when user leaves mode and then comes back?  squadron is still selected but no rendering occurs

* General
** Use prototype.js/Template for heavy-duty HTML-generation stuff
** aerodrome notes need spell checking
** window Resize handling is broken (if window is especially wide)
** Complete docs per Natural Docs

* Art
** label countries (and pushbutton to turn on/off)
** front lines?
** aerodrome notes control button?

* Tools
** change standard date format in XML from m/d/y to YYYYMMDD, which is a little harder to read but is unambiguous and
   requires no further processing (except to YYYY-MM-DD for display).  Requires mk*.rb to be rewritten, though.

* Data
** What's going on with Touquin - 19180712-19180701 is empty -- bad data in RFC 43 Squadron data

*** RFC 18 @ La Brayelle had month 0 -- I used 10
*** RAF 27 @ Viller-Bretonneux has empty day -- I used 15
*** RFC 53 @ Farnborough has month 112 -- I used 12
