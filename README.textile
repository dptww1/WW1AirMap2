h1. WW1 Aero Squadron Maps

A tool for exploring the locations of aero squadrons during World War 1.

The widgets above the map control what you see.

The basic views are:

* _By_ _Aerodrome_, which lets you select an aerodrome to see its location and what was stationed there when
* _By_ _Date_, which lets you see where each squadron was on a given date
* _By_ _Squadron_, which lets you see all the locations where a given squadron was stationed during the war

The national insignia buttons let you filter out squadrons of that nationality.

The cities and rivers buttons let you toggle off those geographical features on the map, which is sometimes useful for seeing the (rather small) aerodrome dots.

Hover your mouse over an aerodrome to see more information about it.

h1. Technical Notes

See "WW1AirMap2":http://www.patriot.net/~townsend/WW1AirMap2 for a usable version.

Implemented entirely in client-side JavaScript using Prototype, wz_dragdrop.js, and wz_jsgraphics.js.

The JS data is constructed from XML source by some custom Ruby scripts in the srcData directory.  They used to be Perl scripts, but the Ruby versions are much cleaner.

This page hasn't been updated to handle wide screens cleanly.  If your browser window is smaller than than the map, you can click and drag the map around a la Google Maps.
