<!-- ======================================================================== -->
<p class="faq">What's all this, then?</p>

<p class="faqa">This is a geographic look at aeroplane squadrons during World War I.  I made it because I
wanted a good overview of the balance of power at any given time, and for squadron movement analysis.
Maybe you'll be interested in such things, too.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================== -->
<p class="faq">It doesn't seem to work for me.</p>

<p class="faqa">Chrome is my main development and testing platform, so if you're using something else, you
may well experience problems.  I sometimes double check to make sure things work on Firefox or Safari, but otherwise
browser compatibility is pretty far down on my list of priorities.  Issues with older versions of IE in particular
are unlikely to get addressed.</p>

<p class="faqa">You also need to have JavaScript turned on in your browser. (If that sentence makes no sense to
you, you probably <i>do</i> have it turned on.)</p>

<p class="faqa">Of course bug reports are always welcome, so feel free to
<a href="mailto:townsend@patriot.net?Subject=WW1AirMap">email me</a> with them.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================== -->
<p class="faq">Boy, some things are slow!</p>

<p class="faqa">There's a fair bit of data to display, and I'm adding more as time goes by.  A
relatively modern machine will be a big help in speeding things up. Otherwise there's not much that I can
do, as speed optimization is also pretty far down my priority list, unfortunately.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================== -->
<p class="faq">So how does this thing work, generally?</p>

<p class="faqa">There are several global controls:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Using the <span class="control">-- Display Type --</span> dropdown, you can view all the aerodromes
    used during the war, or see the situation at any given date, or see where any individual squadron
    was throughout the war.
    <li>You scroll the map a la Google maps (move the mouse pointer over the map, hold down the left mouse button,
    and drag the map to see the hidden bits).  Unlike Google maps, though, I'm only showing the western front.
    Particularly on bigger monitors, you might be able to see the whole thing little need to scroll.
    <li>The nationality buttons in the toolbar will toggle whether or not that nationality is shown on some modes
    (this is still not completely implemented).  Move the mouse pointer over the button to see which nationality
    is which.
    <li>The <span class="control">Toggle City</span> and <span class="control">Toggle Rivers</span> buttons will
    add/remove those features from the map, which is sometimes handy when trying to see the aerodromes.
</ul>

<!-- ======================================================================== -->
<p class="faq">How does the <span class="control">By Aerodrome</span> mode work, exactly?</p>

<p class="faqa">The map shows the location of every aerodrome known to me.  The color of the aerodrome represents
the nationality with the most squadrons stationed there (red = German, olive = Commonwealth, light gray = Belgium).
Move the mouse pointer over the aerodrome dots to see the name of the aerodrome, the squadron(s) stationed there,
and their occupation dates.</p>

<p class="faqa">If you need to find a specific aerodrome, use the <span class="control">-- Select Aerodrome --</span>
dropdown box.  The selected aerodrome will be highlighted and brightened, however it may be offscreen so you
might have to scroll around a bit to find it.  You can use the <span class="control">Toggle Unselected Aerodromes</span>
button to switch off the unselected aerodromes, which can also be a help.</p>

<p class="faqa">The text area below the map will show every aerodrome and the squadrons stationed there at any point
during the war.  Note that some aerodromes are known by name, but not location, so even though you see an aerodrome
at the bottom of the page, you may not be able to find it on the map.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================== -->
<p class="faq">How does the <span class="control">By Date</span> mode work, exactly?</p>

<p class="faqa">The map shows the location of every squadron in the system on 2-Apr-1917.  You can change that date
using the dropdown controls, or use the arrows to move ahead or back to the next date when a squadron moved.
Mouse over the aerodromes to see the squadron(s) stationed at that location.</p>

<p class="faqa">The text area below the map shows each of the squadrons and their location at the given date.
Mouse over the aerodrome name to highlight it on the map.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================== -->
<p class="faq">How does the <span class="control">By Squadron</span> mode work, exactly?</p>

<p class="faqa">Choose a unit from the <span class="control">-- Select Squadron --</span> dropdown to see all
the aerodromes that unit occupied during the war.  (Until you do this, there's really nothing to see in this mode.)</p>

<p class="faqa">The squadron's aerodromes are also listed in chronological order at the bottom of the page. You can
mouse over the aerodrome names to highlight them on the map.</p>

<p class="faqa">Sometimes the map will show discontinous lines, indicating that at least one aerodrome for that
squadron is in an unknown location.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================== -->
<p class="faq">Why don't you show other squadrons, like German BOGOHLs and/or FA(A)s? Or Belgian observation squadrons?
Or any French squadrons at all?</p>

<p class="faqa">Unfortunately, complete location information is not always available, especially for French
and German squadrons, many of whose records were destroyed during World War II. If you happen to have access
to that information, I'd love to <a href="mailto:townsend@patriot.net?Subject=WW1AirMap">hear from you</a>.</p>

<p class="faqa">I expect that I will eventually be able to get the USAS and selected French and German squadrons
online sometime ... please have patience.</p>

<!-- ======================================================================== -->
<p class="faq">How trustworthy is your data?</p>

<p class="faqa">I'd like to think pretty good, actually.  I've taken some pains to sift the data printed
in my sources, which isn't always as straightforward as one might wish.  I've also tried to pay closer attention
to diacritical marks and punctuation than the average English speaker does, so I use Béchamps, not Bechamps.
Editorial help where I've made mistakes is always appreciated -- no matter how hard ones tries, mistakes always get
through!</p>

<p class="faqa">However, even with perfect data there
are a few philosophical issues that pop up with data such as this.  To begin, on any given day I must show
a squadron in a single location, so if the source material says it was in location "A" on 01-Jan through 07-Jan
and then location "B" on 07-Jan through 10-Jan, I've arbitrarily assigned 07-Jan to location "B".  Also, some
of the dates have been estimated.  For example, where the source material says a move happened "in May" without
providing a specific date, I've used the 15th of the month as likely to minimize the error.  (Likewise "at the end
of October","that autumn", etc.)

<!-- ======================================================================== -->
<p class="faq">So, what sources did you use?</p>

<p class="faqa">As you might expect, <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> and
<a href="http://www.mapquest.com">MapQuest</a> were very helpful in tracking down some place names.
In addition, I used the following references:
